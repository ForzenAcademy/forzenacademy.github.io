# Building a Song

This guide can help you create a song from a template.  

You can start with some basics like choosing a bpm for the song to determine how fast it'll be and, if so inclined, what time signature the song will have such as 3/4 or 4/4, etc, then follow the guide below.

## Steps
1. Choose a key
2. Choose a [chord progression](chord_progression.md) of 4 chords
3. Add percussion
4. Create a bassline
5. Create a melody

## 1. Choose a key
The basis of a song is to choose a key. This (broadly) defines what notes your song can contain. To choose a key, start by choosing a note, and then choose a [mode](music_mode.md) that creates a [scale](scales.md). The most common keys are major for upbeat sounds and minor for more somber sounds, but there are others to choose from if you want a specific feel.

## 2. Choose a chord progression
Commonly, templatized music will be layered on top of a progression of 4 chords. Many chord progressions types have names that assist you in knowing which chords are in the progression. For example, the [Andulasian Cadence](andalusian_cadence.md) defines 4 minor chords in a pattern that evokes a feel commonly found in flamenco music.  

Choosing a key can help you quickly flesh out a background layer to your song that you know will sound good.

## 3. Add percussion
Adding percussion can give your song rhythm and energy. The frequency that the percussion hits can increase the energy of the song, whereas no percussion at all can have a low energy feel that evokes more somber emotions.

## 4. Create a bassline
A bassline can give your song a fuller body. Sometimes your chord progression can function as your bassline, and other times you want a lower sound layer to add depth.  

It seems common to have the notes in the loop of the bassline follow the chord in the progression that is currently playing, sometimes opting to just use certain notes from the chord such as the first and fifth.

## 5. Create a melody
Melodies can be tricky. It takes lots of trial and error to get this part right and to match the tone of the song you are trying to convey.  

One common trick is simply to stick to the notes in the entire scale of the chosen key. This will always sound good with your chord progression because they are in the same key.  

Another trick is to play [arpeggios](arpeggio.md) of the currently playing chord, meaning just making a melody of the notes currently playing in the chord.

## Other tips
- **Two-Measure Rule**: After you have an established loop, unless it changes every two measures the long will get boring. Change either the notes being played or the energy of the song by adding or removing instruments.
