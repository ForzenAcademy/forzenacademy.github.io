# Bookkeeping

## Keep a copy of all receipts for purchases and other payments that can be expensed:

* Start up costs (LegalZoom, laptop, etc)

* Rent/Utilities (phone, internet, water, electric etc) [LLC only not S Corp]

* subcontractors

* any other items/programs/subscriptions for the business

* payments to the CPA can be written off as well

## Keep Track of Money In/Out (Make sure it matches bank records)

* Google Sheets or Excel
    * Date, money in/money out, vendor name, description, order/invoice number

* Quickbooks or equivalent program
    * Convenitent especially if you have a lot of transactions and if you decide to do payroll it is needed

## Quickbooks

Using Quickbooks you can keep track of the books and also run payroll if you chose to add that option for an additional fee.

You will need to connect your bank account and approve each transaction as it comes through the account. Each payment that comes through will require you to sort it into the appropriate category (income, subcontractors, equiptment, etc). You can do this as often as appropriate (once a week or a couple times a month for example)

At the end of each month you should recieve bank statements giving you the update on your accounts. Using this every month you do account reconciliation. This compares each transaction marked in Quickbooks to your bank account to make sure everything matches up. If anything is extra or missing you will need to go back and figure out the issue.
