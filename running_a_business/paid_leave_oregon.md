# Paid Leave Oregon

Paid Leave Oregon is a new program that ensures individuals, employers, and families of every kind have the time and support they need to care for themselves and their loved ones when they need it most.  

You will need to file quarterly reports through your [Frances Online](frances_online.md) account.

## How does Paid Leave work?

* Paid Leave lets employees take paid time off when many of life’s most important moments impact our families, health, and safety. Learn about qualifying life events.

* Starting Jan. 1, 2023, employees, regardless of employer size, and large employers with 25 or more employees begin paying into the program.

* Large employers pay 40% of the 1% contribution rate (the amount you pay into the program), and employees pay 60% of the 1% total contribution rate. Learn more about contributions.

* If you’re an employer with fewer than 25 employees, you are considered a small employer. You can choose to contribute, but you are not required to pay into the program. You are required to collect and submit your employees’ contributions starting Jan. 1, 2023. Learn more about your role as a small employer.

* On Sept. 3, 2023, benefits start

## Here’s how to prepare for Paid Leave Oregon:

You need to:

* By Jan. 1, 2023: Post the model notice poster: [https://d1o0i0v5q5lp8h.cloudfront.net/paidleave/stage/assets/resources/Paid-Leave-ModelNotice-Poster-EN.pdf](https://d1o0i0v5q5lp8h.cloudfront.net/paidleave/stage/assets/resources/Paid-Leave-ModelNotice-Poster-EN.pdf)

    * The model notice poster tells employees about Paid Leave Oregon benefits as well as their rights and duties under the program.

    * By Jan. 1, 2023, all employers must post the model notice poster at each work site and provide a copy to all remote employees.

    * It should be posted or sent out in the language(s) you use to communicate with employees.

    * You can download the poster in 11 languages.

* File quarterly payroll reports in Frances Online.
    * You will need to report the total number of employees you have
    * You will need to report the total wages you paid for the quarter 

* Withhold, report, and submit your employees’ contributions. As a small employer with fewer than 25 employees, you do not need to pay the employer contribution, but you still need to withhold, report, and submit your employees’ contributions on the Oregon combined quarterly tax report.

* You will submit the employee contributions through the Oregon [Department of Revenue](department_of_revenue.md) (DOR).

* Give eligible employees time off. You must give your employees paid time off if they are approved for leave by Paid Leave Oregon.

* Hold your employee’s job and role. If your employee has worked for you for more than 90 consecutive days, you must give them their job and position back if the position still exists when they return from paid leave.

You don’t need to:

* Pay the employer portion of the Paid Leave Oregon contribution. 

* Pay your employees while they’re on leave. Paid Leave Oregon pays your employees a portion of their wages while they’re on leave.

* Decide if an employee is eligible for benefits. 

* The Paid Leave program decides if an employee can take paid leave and manages all employee applications and benefits. 

If you choose to pay the employer contribution, here are some things to know:

* You contribute 40% of the total 1% contribution rate.

* You can apply for assistance grants. These grants help cover costs like hiring a temporary replacement employee or helping with other wage-related costs when an employee takes leave. 

    * Learn more about assistance grants here: [https://paidleave.oregon.gov/employers/assistance-grants.html](https://paidleave.oregon.gov/employers/assistance-grants.html)

* You will file your report through Frances Online. 

* You will make your employer contribution through the Oregon Department of Revenue (DOR) on Revenue Online.

## Who’s eligible for Paid Leave benefits?

If someone is eligible for benefits, it means they’re able to participate in Paid Leave. Employees who work in Oregon and who made at least $1,000 the year before they apply for Paid Leave may be eligible for benefits. 

* If you work full time, part time, or for more than one job or employer, it counts.

* If you’re self-employed or an independent contractor, you’re not automatically covered—but you can choose coverage. Find out how to choose coverage and what it means to be self-employed or an independent contractor.

* Tribal governments are not automatically covered, and are not required to participate but can choose to offer coverage.

* Federal government employees are not eligible for Paid Leave benefits.

## What benefits does Paid Leave offer to employees?

* Employees can take up to 12 weeks paid leave in a 52-week period (starting from the day leave begins) for family, medical, or safe leave. If pregnant, in some situations, an employee may be able to take up to 2 more weeks for a total of 14 weeks.

* Employees can choose when and how to take the time off. 

* Paid Leave pays employees a percentage of their wages while they’re on leave.

* Paid leave protects an employee’s job and role if they’ve worked for the same employer for at least 90 consecutive days.
