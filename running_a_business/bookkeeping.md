# Bookkeeping

## Keep a copy of all receipts for purchases and other payments that can be expensed:

* Start up costs (LegalZoom, laptop, etc)

* Rent/Utilities (phone, internet, water, electric etc) [LLC only not S Corp]

* subcontractors

* any other items/programs/subscriptions for the business

* payments to the CPA can be written off as well

## Keep Track of Money In/Out (Make sure it matches bank records)

* Google Sheets or Excel
    * Date, money in/money out, vendor name, description, order/invoice number

* Quickbooks or equivalent program
    * Convenitent especially if you have a lot of transactions and if you decide to do payroll it is needed

## Quickbooks

Using [Quickbooks](quickbooks.md) you can keep track of the books and also run payroll if you chose to add that option for an additional fee.

You will need to connect your bank account and approve each transaction as it comes through the account.

You will want to make sure Quickbooks is set up to take out all of the Taxes necessary.

Quickbooks can help you keep track of which taxes/reports are due when and how to pay them. Some may need to be paid by you and others can be done by Quickbooks.

At the end of each month you should recieve bank statements giving you the update on your accounts. Using this every month you do account reconciliation.
