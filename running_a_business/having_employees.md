# Having Employees

## State Business ID Number (BIN)

If you are going to have Employees (as an S Corp the Owner is considered an employee because you must pay yourself) you must get a [BIN](bin.md) through the state for tax purposes.

* This also gives you your [Unemployment Insurance  Rate](unemployment_insurance_rate.md).

* Register for [Paid Leave Oregon](paid_leave_oregon.md) (If an employer is a new business, they will be included in Paid Leave Oregon when they complete their business registration and receive their BIN).

## Workers Comp Insurance

Oregon requires almost all employers to carry [workers’ compensation insurance](workers_comp_insurance.md) for their employees. If you employ workers in Oregon, you probably need workers’ compensation coverage.

## Oregon Saves

[Oregon Saves](oregon_saves.md) offers retirement plan. Employers must register and employees choose if they want it or not.
