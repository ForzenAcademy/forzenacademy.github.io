# Quarterly Payroll Taxes and Reports

## About payroll taxes
All employers with paid employees working in Oregon must register for a business identification number (BIN) to report and pay Oregon payroll taxes. Corporations without employees must also register to report compensation paid to corporate officers.

Oregon uses a Combined Payroll Tax Reporting System to report all payroll taxes together. The BIN serves as the employer's account number when reporting payroll taxes.

You will need to file Form 132, Form OQ and Schedule B for the report.

You will need to file OR‑OTC-V with your payment.

Filing with Revenue Online you will need to file Form OR-WR electronically.

## Due dates
Oregon withholding taxes are due the same time as your federal taxes. Unemployment, transit taxes, and the Workers' Benefit Fund assessment payments are due the last day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter. Form OQ quarterly reports are due:

* First quarter, due April 30
* Second quarter, due July 31
* Third quarter, due October 31
* Fourth quarter, due January 31
