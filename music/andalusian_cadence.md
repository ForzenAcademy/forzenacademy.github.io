# Andalusian Cadence

A very easy to use [chord progression](chord_progression.md) originating from flamenco. You can use this style of chord progression to create music with the distinctive flamenco flavor.

For a minor sound in the Aeolian mode, use chords **i-VII-VI-V**  
For major sound in the Phrygian mode use **iv-III-II-I**  
  
## Melodies
Common melody patterns can easily be constructed by playing only notes from the root chord chosen for the cadence (with an exception for the final chord below), or playing arpeggios for each chord during its measures.  

In the Aeolian mode and creating melody for the final chord in the progression, use notes from the **Harmonic Minor** scale, not just the **Minor** scale.  

## Aeolian (minor) examples
- **Em - D - C - B**
- **Dm/Dsus4 - C/Csus4 - Bb - A/A7**
- **Am - G - F - E/E7**
