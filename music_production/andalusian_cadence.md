# Andalusian Cadence

A common [chord progression](chord_progression.md) originating from flamenco. You can use this style of chord progression to create music with the distinctive flamenco flavor.

In [Aeolian mode](aeolian_mode.md) use chords **i-bVII-bVI-V**  
In [Phrygian mode](phrygian_mode.md) use chords **iv-III-II-I**  
These numbers correspond to making a chord from the note at the position in the key's natural scale. For a chart of notes in each scale look [here](scales.md).

## Chords
Feel free to mix in suspended chords for a more Latin feel. You can even have a strum pattern of the original chord and then add in brief switches to a suspended chord.

## Melodies
Common melody patterns can be constructed by playing notes from the [scale](scales.md) in the chosen key (with an exception for the final chord below), or playing arpeggios for each chord during its measures.  

For the final chord in the progression, use notes from the **Harmonic Minor** scale rather than the **Minor** [scale](scales.md).

## Bassline
One pattern you can use is using the roots and fifths of each chord during the playing of each chord in the progression.
