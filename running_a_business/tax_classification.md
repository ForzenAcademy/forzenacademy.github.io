# Tax Classification

## Income Tax for Limited Liability Companies 
A limited liability company (LLC) files taxes based on their classification. The default classification of a single member LLC is to be taxed as a sole proprietor. A single member LLC may elect to be taxed as a corporation with the IRS and would follow the same income tax rules as a standard corporation or an S corporation, depending on which election is made.

## Sole Proprietors 
Sole proprietors must file Form 1040 with a Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ to meet their federal income tax obligations. A sole proprietor is liable for self-employment tax and Social Security tax, which is filed on Schedule SE if net profit is $400 or more. To meet state obligations, a sole proprietor files state Form 40 with an attached copy of the federal Form 1040. A sole proprietor may be required to make estimated tax payments.

## Partnership
If the LLC has more than one member, it’s taxed as a partnership by default. Similar to taxation as a sole proprietorship, the taxes incurred by a multi-member LLC would also pass directly through to those partners in the business. This means all owners would handle their business-related taxes on their personal returns and taxed on the LLC’s profits and losses.

The members file an information return on Form 1065 indicating the total profits and losses from the partnership. In addition, the members receive a Schedule K-1 tax form to report their portions of the profit or loss. This form is included with the member’s personal tax retur

## S Corporations 
An S corporation files its federal tax return on Form 1120S. Shareholders receive a Schedule K-1 explaining how to place income, expenses, credit on their personal return Form 1040. The state tax return is filed on Form 20-S with a copy of Federal Form 1120S attached. Shareholders of the S corporation should obtain information on their reporting requirements from the IRS and the Oregon Department of Revenue.

## C Corporations
While it’s complex to structure your LLC as a C-Corporation, it can have some advantages. When the LLC is taxed as a C-Corporation, it means that the LLC is taxed directly as a separate business entity. Unlike taxation as a partnership or sole proprietorship, the taxes incurred by the business are not passed through to the owner’s personal taxes. 

This structure separates the owner’s personal and business assets and also allows businesses to take advantage of deductions. 

However, double taxation is the biggest disadvantage of an LLC taxed as a C-Corporation. Unlike a pass-through entity, an LLC with a C-Corp tax classification is taxed at the corporate and personal levels. The LLC must file an income tax return with the IRS for the business, while the owners must also file personal income taxes.

The owners of the LLC should make the appropriate decision for the tax classification of the LLC based on the tax benefits and savings that the business may be able to enjoy. While filing changes for LLC tax status to a C- or an S-corporation, it’s best to consult a tax professional for assistance and advice.
