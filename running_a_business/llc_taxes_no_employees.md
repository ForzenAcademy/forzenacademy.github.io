# LLC Taxes (No Employees)

## Estimated tax
Generally, you must pay taxes on income, including self-employment tax, by making regular quarterly payments of estimated tax during the year. A CPA can help you figure out your payments if you would prefer.

LLCs are [classified](tax_classification.md) as “pass-through” entities for tax reasons, meaning the business profits and losses will flow through to the personal tax return of each member.

LLC's can be classified in multiple ways for tax purposes: 
* The default for a single member LLC is Sole Proprietors

* The default for a multiple member LLC is Partnership

* Corporation (S Corp or C Corp) needs to be filed for separately

## Self-Employment Tax
Self-employment tax (SE tax) is a social security and Medicare tax primarily for individuals who work for themselves.

Generally, every quarter you must pay SE tax and file Schedule SE (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) if your net earnings from self-employment were $400 or more.

## Quarterly Taxes
For estimated tax purposes, the year is divided into four payment periods. Each period has a specific payment due date. If you don't pay enough tax by the due date of each payment period, you may be charged a penalty even if you're due a refund when you file your income tax return at the end of the year.

Due Dates (If falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the payment will be on time if you make it on the next day that's not a weekend or legal holiday):

* Quarter 1 (January-March): April 15th

* Quarter 2 (April-June): June 15th

* Quarter 3 (July-September): September 15th

* Quarter 4 (October-December): January 15th

## Estimated Income Tax Payments (Individual) 
A sole proprietor, or limited liability company member may be required to make quarterly estimated income tax payments. In most cases, if you expect to owe at least $1,000 in federal taxes for the year after subtracting any withholding and tax credits, you must file Form 1040-ES each quarter with the IRS. Or, taxes can be paid using the free Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). Generally, if you expect to owe $1,000 or more on the tax-to-pay line on your Oregon tax return, you are required to file Form 40-ESV each quarter with the Oregon Department of Revenue. Interest is assessed if payments are not made when they are due.
