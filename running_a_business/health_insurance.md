# Health Insurance

You may choose to offer health insurance to your employees.

You usually cannot get small business health insurance or a group plan through your LLC if you have no employees, although you can still get individual health insurance as an LLC owner or member.

If your LLC does not have employees besides yourself, you would most likely be a sole proprietor and could only enroll in individual health insurance, not small business health insurance.

However, sole proprietorships with one employee besides the business owner can usually qualify for group health coverage.

## Can an LLC deduct health insurance premiums?

Getting a health insurance LLC deduction depends on whether the deduction is being taken out for non-member employees or members of the LLC, as well as the legal and tax status of the LLC and whether the LLC is classified as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. According to LegalZoom:

* For non-member employees – An LLC can deduct the cost of medical insurance for all employees who are not members of the LLC. This deduction can also include the amount the LLC pays for employees to have qualified long-term health coverage.

* For the self-employed – Members of an LLC are considered self-employed if their LLC is a sole proprietorship or partnership. While self-employed business owners can deduct the cost of acquiring health insurance for themselves, a spouse, and qualified dependents, they may or may not be able to qualify for small business health insurance. For example, sole proprietors usually would not qualify for a group plan unless they have employees, but a sole proprietor could still enroll in an individual health insurance plan.

* For corporations – If shareholders of an LLC receive corporate tax treatment, they would not be considered eligible to receive health insurance from the business unless they are bona fide employees. If a corporation provides health insurance to non-employee shareholders, then the company could not take this deduction on their corporate tax return.
