An EIN is a 9-digit number (for example, 12-3456789) assigned to sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships, estates, trusts, and other entities for tax filing and reporting purposes.

**A federal employment identification number (FEIN) is the same thing as an employer identification number (EIN).** The only exception to this rule is when someone uses the abbreviation EIN to refer to a state tax identification number.

## Information about applying for EIN:
### Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility
* You may apply for an EIN online if your principal business is located in the United States or U.S. Territories.
* The person applying online must have a valid Taxpayer Identification Number (SSN, ITIN, EIN).
* You are limited to one EIN per responsible party per day.
* The “responsible party” is the person who ultimately owns or controls the entity or who exercises ultimate effective control over the entity. Unless the applicant is a government entity, the responsible party must be an individual (i.e., a natural person), not an entity.

### Step 2: Understand the Online Application
You must complete this application in one session, as you will not be able to save and return at a later time. 

Your session will expire after 15 minutes of inactivity, and you will need to start over.

### Step 3: Submit Your Application
After all validations are done you will get your EIN immediately upon completion. You can then download, save, and print your EIN confirmation notice.
