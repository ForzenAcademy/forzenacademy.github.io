# Chord Progression

A way to move between chords in an established pattern. Many chord progressions have names for their pattern and have stood the test of time. Choosing an established progression can can make it easy to give off a distinct tone or sound to your music.  

Lower case chords are minor, upper case are major.

## Examples
- [**Andalusian Cadence**](andalusian_cadence.md) **i-bVII-bVI-V**  
A popular progression from flamenco. String descending pattern.

- **Axis Progression** **I-V-vi-IV**  
Very common in Western pop music. A rollercoaster of tension keeps the loop progressing. You can flip the start of this progression to **vi-IV-I-V** to have a more dramatic sound, also common in Western pop music.

- **Royal Road Progression** **IV-V-iii-vi**  
A popular progression from Japanese music. Very common in anime. This progression builds string tension and doesn't release it entirely, keeping the journey going.

- **Aeolian Vamp** **i-bVII-bVI-bVII**  
This has a natural minor color with a less directional sound within a floaty space. It's less direct than the Andalusian Cadence while sounding very similar.  

- **Doo-wop** **I-vi-IV-V** 
This progression was very common in 50s Doo-wop music. This chord progression is a good journey away from the tonic and then back to the tonic.
