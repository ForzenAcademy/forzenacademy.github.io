Report new Employees to the Department of Justice (DOJ)

Employers must report all new and rehired employees within 20 days of their hire date.

## How to Report New Hires to the Oregon DOJ Division of Child Support

Oregon law requires employers to report within 20 days all new hires and re-hires, including temporary staff, to the Division of Child Support of the Oregon Department of Justice. Employers must report the first day of work for each new hire. We use this information to collect child support payments.

A “new hire” is any employee who is required to fill out a W-4 form, or any returning employee who has been absent for more than 60 days.

We recommend employers use the Oregon Employer Services Portal [https://employerportal.oregonchildsupport.gov/index.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f](https://employerportal.oregonchildsupport.gov/index.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) to report new hires and terminations, as well as update employee or employer information. Using the portal, employers may submit multiple new hires at one time by uploading a spreadsheet or text file with the required information. Employers may also opt to complete the Oregon New Hire Reporting Form [https://www.doj.state.or.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Oregon_New_Hire_Reporting_Form.pdf](https://www.doj.state.or.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Oregon_New_Hire_Reporting_Form.pdf) and fax to 1-877-877-7415, or return it by mail to:
