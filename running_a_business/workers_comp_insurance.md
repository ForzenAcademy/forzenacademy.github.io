# Workers Comp Insurance

Oregon requires almost all employers to carry workers’ compensation insurance for their employees. If you employ workers in Oregon, you probably need workers’ compensation coverage.

You can attain this through Quickbooks or find your own company/agency to work with.

## Am I an employer?

If you employ one or more workers, you are an employer. A worker is anyone you pay to do work for you who is not an independent contractor. You do not have to provide workers’ compensation coverage to independent contractors, though you may choose to do so.

## Is my worker a subject worker?

Every worker in Oregon is a subject worker unless the worker falls under an exemption. There are about 30 exemptions in Oregon law.

Additional information regarding exemptions that an Oregon worker may fall under can be found by reviewing OR 656.027:

## How do I get workers’ compensation coverage?

If you are an employer with one or more subject workers, you must purchase an Oregon workers' compensation policy. The insurer will file proof of coverage on your behalf.

You can get insurance from any insurer authorized to provide workers’ compensation coverage in Oregon. There are more than 300 such companies approved to write workers’ compensation policies. Many of these insurers sell policies through agents. Often, the agency that handles your other business insurance can help you place your workers’ compensation insurance. Some insurers will deal directly with you, and a few have made special arrangements to provide workers’ compensation through business organizations or associations.

All employers in Oregon that are required to provide workers' compensation coverage must display a Notice of Compliance poster in a central gathering area, such as a breakroom. Employers automatically receive a Notice of Compliance poster when they first get coverage or change coverage providers.

Once you have the posting notice, it remains valid as long as the policy remains active. You can make and post copies of valid posters. If the policyholder, employer name, or the insurer changes, you will automatically receive a new poster. A change only in the policy number — which is a common practice at annual renewal — does not require a new posting notice.

Each poster includes workers' compensation information to help workers and employers provide current insurance information to health care providers at the time of injury to speed up the claims process.
