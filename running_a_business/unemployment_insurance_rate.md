# Unemployment Insurance (UI) Rate

Employer payroll taxes are placed in Oregon’s  UI Trust Fund at the U.S. Treasury. This fund can only be used to pay unemployment insurance benefits. It provides unemployment insurance benefits to workers who are out of work through no fault of their own. 

## Oregon’s tax structure is self-balancing, with two major parts:

Movement between eight tax schedules: When the tax schedule changes, all employers move to that tax schedule.

How an employer is assigned a tax rate within a schedule: Individual employer tax rates depend on their ‘experience rating’ or benefit ratio, which measures the rate at which their employees have received UI benefits.​

## What is the 2023 tax rate?

Unemployment tax rates for employers subject to Oregon payroll tax will move to tax schedule two for the 2023 calendar year. The 2023 payroll tax schedule ranges from .7%-5.4%, with an base rate (for new employers) of 2.1 percent on the first $50,900 paid to each employee. 

The Oregon Employment Department mails notifications to businesses regarding their individual tax rates and encourages employers to wait until they receive their individual notice before attempting to contact the department with questions. Any employer who has not received their notice by Nov. 22, 2022​, can email OED_TAX_STATUS@employ.oregon.gov​ or call 503-947-1488. Due to the projected high call volume, we encourage employers to contact us by email
