# Music Mode

The Greek names that modern [scale](scales.md) patterns originated from.  
  
The first pattern is [Ionian](ionian_mode.md), another name for the major natural scale. To make an Ionian (major) scale the notes follow this pattern where W is a whole step between notes and H is a half step:  
**WWHWWWH**  
  
The other modes shift the starting position in the same pattern based on this ordering
- [Ionian](ionian_mode.md) (major)
- Dorian
- [Phrygian](phrygian_mode.md)
- Lydian
- Mixolydian
- [Aeolion](aeolian_mode.md) (minor)
- Locrian

For example, **Dorian** mode would shift the pattern one to the left, making its notes follow **WHWWWHW**
