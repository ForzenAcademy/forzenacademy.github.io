# Quickbooks

Using Quickbooks you can keep track of the books and also run payroll if you chose to add that option for an additional fee.

## Transactions

You will need to connect your bank account and approve each transaction as it comes through the account. Each payment that comes through will require you to sort it into the appropriate category (income, subcontractors, equiptment, etc). You can do this as often as appropriate (once a week or a couple times a month for example).

## Taxes

You will want to make sure Quickbooks is set up to take out all of the Taxes necessary. Most should be done automatically. Paid Leave Oregon has an extra step. When going into settings you can see it is supposed to be set up however before running payroll you will need to make sure to select the option to have Paid Leave Oregon (OR Paid Family and Medical Leave) Taxes taken out of employees checks.

If you recieve an notices about owing to the State after the quarter that means something was missed and you should address this as soon as possible so next quarter wont hold the same problem. If your CPA offers accounting help you can contact them for help otherwise you will need to go through records to find out with taxes are incorrectly accounted for and either find a way to correct this or contact Quickbooks to correct this.

Quickbooks can help you keep track of which taxes/reports are due when and how to pay them. Some may need to be paid by you and others can be done by Quickbooks.

Taxes and reports can be automatically done through Quickbooks. You can go into settings and there should be an option to allow Quicksbooks to automatially pay and send in reports. This may not be available until your second quarter and you paid the first one yourself.

## Reconcile

At the end of each month you should recieve bank statements giving you the update on your accounts. Using this every month you do account reconciliation. This compares each transaction marked in Quickbooks to your bank account to make sure everything matches up. If anything is extra or missing you will need to go back and figure out the issue.
